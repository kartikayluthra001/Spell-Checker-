# Spell-Checker-
Seeing the hype behind the language I thought to give some time out to learn Rust, although I am fairly new to the language
I tried creating my first project which is a basic command line spell-checker, I like how as a backend developer I can just create
CLI tools and avoid the various complexities of developing a frontend, for my application, As a former UX Developer I want to apologize

Although this is a fairly simple version of a spell-checker since I have not created this for a distributed environment or a big system
where usually Bloom Filters data structure is used, I have used Tries to focus more on accuracy and less on performance.
